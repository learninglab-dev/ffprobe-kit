Then put the following lines inside your if statement, so ffprobe runs only on your video and not on any other files in the directory:

      var pathToVideo = `${dirPath}/${files[i]}`;

      var ffprobe = cp.spawnSync("ffprobe", ['-v', 'quiet', '-print_format', 'json', '-show_format', '-show_streams', pathToVideo], { encoding : 'utf8' });
